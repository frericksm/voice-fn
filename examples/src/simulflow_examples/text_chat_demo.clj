  ;; Interactive usage examples:
  
  ;; 1. Basic usage
  (def chat (start-text-chat!))
  ;; Now type in the console:
  ;; You: Hello, how are you?
  ;; Assistant: Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking...
  
  ;; 2. With debug mode
  (def debug-chat (start-text-chat! {:debug? true}))
  
  ;; 3. With custom system message
  (def expert-chat (start-text-chat! 
                    {:llm-context 
                     {:messages
                      [{:role "system" 
                        :content "You are a technical expert in Clojure programming. Be detailed and precise."}]}}))
  
  ;; 4. Stop the chat manually (or just ask to quit)
  (flow/stop chat)
  
  ;; 5. Test the weather function
  ;; You: What's the weather like in Paris?
  ;; Assistant: I'll check the weather in Paris for you.
  ;; [Tool call executed]
  ;; The weather in Paris is 17 degrees celsius
